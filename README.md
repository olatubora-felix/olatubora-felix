# Hi there! 👋 I'm Olatubora Felix  

### 🚀 About Me  
I am a **Senior Software Engineer** with 6+ years of experience specializing in JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Next.js, PHP, and Laravel. I build secure, scalable SaaS applications and FinTech solutions, excelling in state management, responsive design, and data visualization with tools like Redux, Tailwind CSS, and Apache eCharts.

I bring deep expertise in Laravel, crafting RESTful APIs, integrating third-party services, and implementing robust authentication systems with Laravel Sanctum and Passport. Skilled in optimizing Eloquent ORM and database queries, I ensure high performance and maintainability in my applications.

A dedicated mentor, I am passionate about empowering junior developers through code reviews, technical guidance, and structured learning paths. I also specialize in PWAs, JavaScript SDKs, and testing frameworks like Jest and Vitest while leveraging modern tools like Webpack, Vite, and CI/CD pipelines. Thriving in agile teams, I collaborate seamlessly through Jira, Slack, and GitHub.
